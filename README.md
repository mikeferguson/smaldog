#SMALdog v1.5 (Eth-bridge Based)
This is the PC-side code (firmware is in the stm32 repo under projects).

#Road Map
 * Initial Python implementation of drivers, IK, interpolation (mostly done)
 * Python implementation of basic gaits
 * Get IMU interfaced
 * Convert drivers, interpolation to C++ (boost::asio)
 * Probably convert IK to C++
 * Find old pylab based tools and check in
